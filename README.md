# Dual-Port-RAM-Verification-Using-SystemVerilog


Developed and verified a Dual-Port RAM design using a custom SystemVerilog-based testbench environment. The project involved creating a modular and reusable testbench to validate simultaneous read and write operations on two independent ports. Implemented constrained random stimulus generation and coverage-driven verification to test various corner cases, including concurrent access scenarios and read/write conflicts. The environment included components such as drivers, monitors, and a scoreboard to automatically compare expected and actual outputs. Achieved 100% functional coverage and successfully identified design bugs, ensuring robust functionality under different stress conditions.
